## 😎About the repository
This repository contains problem questions related to DSA, Greedy, Math and beginner friendly topics. You can use any programming language of your preference and contribute to this repo.

## 📢General Steps to follow while contributing:

### Step Zero
- Look for issues already submitted in the __Issues__ tab, and comment "I want to work on this issue"
- Wait till the owner of the repo assigns you the issue, and then your'e good to go
- If you want to add solution for a problem of your choice, "Create a new issue, submit and comment to work on the issue"

### Step One
- Once you are assigned the issue, fork the repo to your profile 🍴 by clicking the __Fork__ button on the top right corner 
- Clone the repo to your local machine: ```$ git clone "your forked repo URL"``` run the command in git bash on your PC/ Mac 💻
- Go to the directory for the issue you're working on, then create a folder named on the programming lang. your solution is in (ex: Python) and copy your solution in that directory (for example, Searching & Sorting -> Cyclic Sort -> Python -> solution.py )
- Add your name to the __Contributors.md__ file

### Step Two
- After succesfully following the above steps, open Git Bash on your PC/ Mac.
- Create a new branch by your Github username and checkout the branch: ```$ git checkout -b "username"``` (branch name should be your GitHub username strictly, ___Always try to make changes on a new branch rather than directly on the master branch, which can corrupt the codebase while working on some high profile, complicated program___) 
- Add files changed: ```$ git add .```
- Commit the changes: ```$ git commit -m "commit message"``` (commit message should be meaningful and precise, example: __git commit -m "added searching solution in Java"__)
- Push the changes to make a successful PR: ```$ git push origin your-branch-name```
- That's it 🎉💥
